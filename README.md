# landing-page
An example of a common landing page layout.

Based on an exercise from The Odin Project to create a
common landing page layout using CSS Flexbox mode.

Implemented with a modular architecture, each
section of the page is clearly delimited with its own 
CSS file, and drawing from a universal general.css file.

Sections included in this landing page example:
 - Basic navbar with logo and menu
 - A header section (Hero)
 - A section for image/icon thumbs
 - A section for a quote
 - A section for a CTA (call to action)
 - A basic footer

Note: There are not other pages in this sample, and 
the links do not go anywhere.
